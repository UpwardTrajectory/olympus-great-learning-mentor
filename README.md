# Great Learning Mentored Learning Sessions
### final code AFTER the MLS has taken place

This repo contains the raw data & finished notebooks after walking through various Mentored Learning sessions w/ my cohort.

Note: If this breaks any code sharing policies, please contact me and I will set this repo to private. This was the easiest & fastest way to share my code w/ my students, and it allowed me to give them a quick demo in 'Git Fundamentals' at the same time.

The original notebooks and data were provided from the MLS sections found here: https://olympus.greatlearning.in/courses/44502/
