    "### Background : \n",
    "McCurr Consultancy is an MNC that has thousands of employees spread across the globe. The company believes in hiring the best talent available and retaining them for as long as possible. A huge amount of resources is spent on retaining existing employees through various initiatives. The Head of People Operations wants to bring down the cost of retaining employees. For this, he proposes limiting the incentives to only those employees who are at risk of attrition. As a recently hired Data Scientist in the People Operations Department, you have been asked to identify patterns in characteristics of employees who leave the organization. Also, you have to use this information to predict if an employee is at risk of attrition. This information will be used to target them with incentives.\n",

    "* EmployeeNumber is an ID variable and not useful for predictive modeling.\n",

    "**Observations from EDA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `age`: The variable Age is normally distributed with an average equal to 37 years. Age is positively correlated JobLevel and Education (i.e., the older an employee is, the more educated and at a higher job level they are).\n",
    "* `DailyRate`: It is having a fairly uniform distribution with an average of 800. Employees having lower Daily rates and less monthly wage are more likely to attrite.\n",
    "* `DistanceFromHome`: This shows a right-skewed distribution. Most people stay at a close distance from home with few also leaving away from work. Employees who have to travel a more distance from their home attrite more.\n",
    "* `HourlyRate`: It is an almost uniformly distributed variable. It has mean and median approx equal to 65. The hourly rate doesn't have much impact on attrition.\n",
    "* `MonthlyIncome`: Monthly Income distribution is almost right-skewed. Few employees are earning much higher than the rest of the employees.  MonthlyIncome is highly correlated to Job Level (0.95). \n",
    "* `MonthlyRate`: It is a uniformly distributed variable with a median close to 14500. The monthly rate doesn't have much impact on attrition.\n",
    "* `NumCompaniesWorked`: On average people have worked at 2.5 companies with a median of 2 companies. The majority of people have worked in only one company. Approx 350 people are freshers. There are employees worked at 9 companies. They will be the outliers.\n",
    "* `PercentSalaryHike`:  It has a right-skewed distribution. It is correlated with performance rating with a coefficient of 0.77. Lesser salary hike also contributes to attrition.\n",
    "* `TotalWorkingYears`: Work experience is having a significant right skew. It also contains few outliers.\n",
    "* `YearsAtCompany`: Significantly skewed towards the right. Also contains outliers.\n",
    "* `YearsInCurrentRole`: It is having few outliers. The lower whisker coincides with the first quartile.\n",
    "* `YearsWithCurrManager`: It is a right-skewed variable with few outliers too.\n",
    "* `BusinessTravel`: Almost 71% of employees have travel rarely and 19% travel frequently. As the travel frequency increases of an employee increases, the Attrition rate increases. There's a ~22% probability of employees attriting who travel frequently.\n",
    "* `Department`: The R&D department consists of almost 65% of employees.\n",
    "* `EducationField`:People with Life science background is dominant over others with almost 41% count.\n",
    "* `Gender`: 60% of people are male while the rest are female.\n",
    "* `JobRole`: Almost 22% of people are sales executives followed by 20% research scientists.\n",
    "* `MaritalStatus`: Almost 46% of people are married and 32% are single.\n",
    "* `OverTime`: Only almost 29% of people are ready to do overtime. Employees who work overtime tend to attrite more. There a ~35% probability of attrition among employees working overtime.\n",
