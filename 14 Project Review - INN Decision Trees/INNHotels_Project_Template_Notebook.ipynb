    "# INN Hotels Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant number of hotel bookings are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customers’ booking possibilities and behavior. This adds a further dimension to the challenge of how hotels handle cancellations, which are no longer limited to traditional booking and guest characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cancellation of bookings impact a hotel on various fronts:\n",
    "* Loss of resources (revenue) when the hotel cannot resell the room.\n",
    "* Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.\n",
    "* Lowering prices last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reducing the profit margin.\n",
    "* Human resources to make arrangements for the guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The increasing number of cancellations calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. INN Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal, they are facing problems with the high number of booking cancellations and have reached out to your firm for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist have to analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "The data contains the different attributes of customers' booking details. The detailed data dictionary is given below.\n",

    "* no_of_previous_cancellations: Number of previous bookings that were canceled by the customer prior to the current booking\n",
    "* no_of_previous_bookings_not_canceled: Number of previous bookings not canceled by the customer prior to the current booking\n",
    "* avg_price_per_room: Average price per day of the reservation; prices of the rooms are dynamic. (in euros)\n",
